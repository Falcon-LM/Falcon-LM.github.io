We are excited to introduce **Falcon Arabic**, a 7B parameter language model that sets a new benchmark for Arabic NLP. Built on the Falcon 3 architecture, Falcon Arabic is a multilingual model that supports Arabic, English, and several other languages. It excels in general knowledge, Arabic grammar, mathematical reasoning, complex problem solving, and understanding the rich diversity of Arabic dialects.

Falcon Arabic redefines the boundaries of what is possible for Arabic language models. It significantly outperforms other Arabic LLMs in its size category—and even models up to four times larger—across both Arabic-native models and those adapted from other languages. This makes Falcon Arabic not only a state-of-the-art model in terms of performance, but also a uniquely efficient and accessible solution for developers and researchers working with the Arabic language.

Whether you are generating high-quality Arabic content, exploring the nuances of dialects, or solving complex tasks that require deep reasoning and arithmetic, Falcon Arabic is the model that will change the way we interact with the Arabic language in AI.


# Introducing Falcon Arabic: Advancing LLMs for the Arabic-Speaking World

In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have redefined what’s possible with artificial intelligence. From powering virtual assistants to enabling real-time translation, content generation, and advanced search capabilities, LLMs have become the foundation of modern language understanding and generation. Trained on vast datasets and designed to scale, these models have enabled machines to interpret and produce human language with remarkable fluency and contextual awareness.

However, much of this progress has been centered around high-resource languages like English, leaving many world languages—including Arabic—underrepresented. Arabic presents a unique set of linguistic challenges: it is morphologically rich, diglossic (featuring both Modern Standard Arabic and numerous spoken dialects), and spans a wide and diverse speaker base. Developing high-quality Arabic LLMs is not only a technical necessity but a cultural and social imperative—ensuring that Arabic-speaking users can fully benefit from the capabilities of modern AI.

With that goal in mind, we’re excited to announce **Falcon Arabic**—a specialized adaptation of the **Falcon 3** models, fine-tuned specifically for Arabic. Falcon Arabic builds on the strong foundation of the Falcon family, which was developed by the **Technology Innovation Institute (TII)** in the United Arab Emirates. The Falcon models have made a significant global impact by offering open, high-performance alternatives to closed-source LLMs, with leading benchmarks in multilingual tasks and efficient training at scale.

Falcon Arabic extends this impact by bringing state-of-the-art LLM performance to the Arabic-speaking world. By tailoring the model to understand both Modern Standard Arabic and key regional dialects, Falcon Arabic addresses critical gaps in existing language technologies—paving the way for more inclusive, locally relevant AI applications across the Middle East and North Africa.
